            In order to submit payments as well as to receive prizes, we will use the native
            coin of Polygon, MATIC. This is why you should have enough of them in your account to use this Dapp,
            for example, at the time of betting for a number. To buy MATICs, there are multiple options, so choose
            the one you prefer üòâ:

              You can use all the possible exchangers there are in the market like <a href='https://www.binance.com'>Binance</a>, {' '}
              <a href='https://www.coinbase.com'>Coinbase</a>, etc., to get MATICs in exchange of ETH, Bitcoin or FIAT (euros, dolars, etc.).
              Then, you'll have to transfer those MATICs from the exchanger to your account in Metamask.

            <li>
              Finally, another possibility is to change FIAT (euros, dolars, etc.) for MATICs using apps like {' '}

          Once you have MATICs in your account, now it's time for you to play!! There are 3
          ways to bet on a number: One of them is simply buy a number for 2 USD among the 10 possible ones.
          The other way is to buy the exclusivity of that number, which means that nobody else can buy it, for
          18 USD. The final way depends on your strategy, maybe you don't want to buy the full exclusivity, but
          you feel that number can give you luck, so you can decide to buy more than once that number.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Anyway, bear in mind that you can always buy as many numbers as you want,
          whether it is individually or get full exclusivity, we let you make this decision.

          times, which means that another 10 people could have bought it too, unless you have bought the
          exclusivity of that number, in which case you are the only owner of it. Prizes are distributed among
          the purchasers of the winning number. If you were the only one who bought it or you have the exclusitivity,
          the whole prize is yours. However, if there was 5 more purchasers, then the prize is distributed
